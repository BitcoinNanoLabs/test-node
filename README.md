### What is BitcoinBlack?

BitcoinBlack is a community based currency focussed on a fair distribution and giving the power back to the people.
Fee free & Instant transactions are made over a secure decentralized network with very low energy output.<br>
The current version of Bitcoin Black is built upon a codebase fork of Nano.
It is neither a hard fork or soft fork of Nano as it does not share the same chain.

### Key Features

* BitcoinBlack utilizes block-lattice architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Bitcoin Black an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
